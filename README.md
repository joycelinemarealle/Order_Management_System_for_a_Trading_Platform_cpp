Order Management System (C++)
I built this Order Management System to practice modern C++ while learning how real-world trading and brokerage systems work behind the scenes.

The system allows users to create, update, and cancel buy or sell orders. It supports basic matching logic, keeps a history of all orders, and handles user input from a simple command-line interface.

I used this project to reinforce core C++ skills such as object-oriented programming, memory management, references and pointers, and templates. It also gave me a hands-on way to think about system design and trade flows in a low-latency environment.

My next steps are to add order matching logic, support for multiple users, and maybe explore file persistence or logging.
