**C++ Low-Latency Order Management System**

A modular Order Management System built in modern C++17, simulating the core mechanics of trading and brokerage platforms.

**Key Features**

- Order Lifecycle Management: Supports order creation, cancellation, and status tracking via a command-line interface (CLI).

- Buy/Sell Matching Engine: Implements core order matching logic with support for partial and full order fills.

- Fill Tracking: Automatically updates filled quantities and order status after each trade.

- Interactive CLI: Lightweight interface for testing order actions without a graphical UI.

- Modern C++ Practices: Applied object-oriented design, STL containers, memory management, and clean code principles.
  
- Unit Testing: Verified core functionality through unit tests covering order creation, matching logic, and fill behavior.

 **Why This Project?**

This project deepened my understanding of:

- How trading systems process and match orders in real-time

- Efficient C++ design in performance-sensitive environments

- Clean separation of concerns using classes like Order, OrderManager, and CLI

**Next Steps**

- Add file-based persistence and logging

- Expand to support multiple users

- Write unit tests for core functionalities
